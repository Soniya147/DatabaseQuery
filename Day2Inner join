Question 1    Inner Join 
SELECT *
FROM Customer c
INNER JOIN Orders o 
    ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;


Question 2 What happens to the records that do NOT match in INNER JOIN?
👉 Non-matching rows are filtered out.

Table A
| Id |
| -- |
| 1  |
| 2  |

Table B

| Id |
| -- |
| 2  |
| 3  |

Result → only 2

👉 1 and 3 will NOT come
👉 not even NULL


Question 3 Can INNER JOIN be used between more than two tables?

Yes, INNER JOIN can be used to join more than two tables by adding multiple join conditions.
SELECT *
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
INNER JOIN Payments p ON o.OrderId = p.OrderId;

CROSS JOIN

👉 Combines every row of first table with every row of second table.

If:

Table A → 3 rows

Table B → 4 rows

Result = 3 × 4 = 12 rows.

Example
Customers
Id
1
2
Products
Id
10
20

result:

| CustomerId | ProductId |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 10        |
| 1          | 20        |
| 2          | 10        |
| 2          | 20        |


SELECT *
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Products;


 SELF JOIN  👉 A table joined with itself.

Used when table contains related data inside same table.


| EmpId | Name  | ManagerId |
| ----- | ----- | --------- |
| 1     | Ram   | NULL      |
| 2     | Shyam | 1         |


SELECT e.Name AS Employee, m.Name AS Manager
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees m 
ON e.ManagerId = m.EmpId;
