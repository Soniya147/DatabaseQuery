Question1      What is SQL Server?
👉 SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is used to store, manage, and retrieve data, and we use SQL language to perform operations like insert, update, delete, and select.

Question2   What is a database?
👉 Database is a structured collection of data stored in a system, which allows users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve information efficiently.

Question3  What is a table in SQL Server?
👉 A table is a structured format in SQL Server where data is stored in rows and columns Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field of the data.

Question4   What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?
👉| CHAR                    | VARCHAR                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fixed size              | Variable size             |
| Always uses full memory | Uses only required memory |
| Faster sometimes        | Saves space               |

example
Name CHAR(10)
and you store → Ram

👉 SQL Server will still use 10 characters (Ram + 7 spaces).

Name VARCHAR(10)
👉 it will use only 3 characters.

Question 5   What is a Primary Key?

👉A Primary Key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It does not allow NULL values or duplicate values.

Question 6  What is a Foreign Key?
👉 Foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.

Question 7 What is the difference between Primary Key and Foreign Key?
| Primary Key                | Foreign Key                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Uniquely identifies record | Refers to primary key of another table |
| No NULL, No duplicate      | Can have duplicate, sometimes NULL     |
| One per table              | Multiple allowed                       |
| Parent table               | Child table                            |

Question 8    DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP
👉 DELETE is used to remove specific rows using a WHERE condition, and it logs each row deletion.
TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table without removing the structure, it is faster, and it resets the identity.
DROP removes the complete table including its structure, data, indexes, and constraints.

Question 9  What is a JOIN in SQL Server?
